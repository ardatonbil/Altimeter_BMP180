In this project, an altimeter is designed by me and Mustafa Canıtez. 
Hardware setup includes BMP180 barometric pressure sensor, ATMega2560 microcontroller,
and 16x2 LCD screen. Serial communication protocols such as I2C, SPI, and UART are implemented through C.
QNH data is obtained from Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport's databases, and the altimeter is calculated through
the formulas provided in BMP180's datasheet.
